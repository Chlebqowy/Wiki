# Map editor installation
Learn how to map using the Sound Space Quantum Editor (SSQE, for short)

## Installing the Editor

- Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/David20122/SSQEUpdater/releases/latest) and click on the __.zip__ file.
- Once you have downloaded the .zip file, __extract it__.
- Once the zip file is extracted, run <u>SSQEUpdater.exe</u>. The Editor will be automatically set up and will also run afterward.

If the updater isn't running, you might have not extracted the file properly.
