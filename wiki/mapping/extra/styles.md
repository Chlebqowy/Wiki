# Extra 01: Styles
Learn how to develop a mapping style

## Introduction
A style is a way of producing patterns for maps. Different mappers may have different understanding of what mapping is,
or reasons to map, such as:
- Self-accomplishment
- Public recognition
- Pushing the skill ceiling further up
- etc.  

In this document, we'll go over the main mapping styles in Rhythia.

:::details
This game shares gameplay similarities with "Mania" rhythm games (such as "osu!mania").
According to this approach, there are 2 main types of maps:
- **Speed**
- **Tech**
These can be applied to Rhythia as follows.
:::

### Mainstream/Speed
The most basic style, involving simple patterns which rely on **stamina/drain** and **consistency**.   
Most maps follow this style because most players barely struggle at playing it.
- Some examples are:
  - Hi
  - 

### Tech
This style focuses on technical patterns, which require great **reading** and **control** skills.   
Although it can be very complex to fully understand, we can subdivide tech into categories based on the skill requirements:
- **Light tech**: Focuses lightly on both skills
  - Example: 
- Heavy tech: Focuses on both skills 
  - Example:
- **Unconventional**: Focuses heavily on reading
  - Example:
- **Antiflow**: Focuses heavily on control
  - Example:
  
## Summary
- You may develop your style depending on your gameplay experience, your own ideas and how you envision maps. 
- Although not all maps fall strictly into one category, they may be recognised by their closest end on the style spectrum.
