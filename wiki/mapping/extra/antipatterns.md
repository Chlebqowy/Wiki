# Extra 03: Antipatterns
Learn how to identify common problems in your maps

## Introduction
An anti-pattern, also used in programming, is used to define a common problem in a possible solution
and its possible causes.

In Rhythia, the equivalent would be to find common flaws in maps.
We can also distinguish 3 types of anti-patterns depending on the topic they're related to:
- Execution/Gameplay
- Representation/Sync
- Creativity

### Execution anti-patterns
- **Difficulty dragging**: A map section's difficulty is greatly inflated/deflated forcefully by the mapper,
who wants a map that can fit in their envisioned difficulty range. 

:::details
This concept encompasses both difficulty spikes and difficulty drops.
:::

- **The Safe Player**: The patterns in the map feel way too predictable, so the player is not engaged.

### Representation anti-patterns
- **Overmapping/Undermapping**: The map has sections which are too dense/intense for the map.
- **BPM/Offset misusage**: The map has got at least one timing point wrong.

### Creativity anti-patterns
- **The Copying Machine**: The map is too similar to past maps of the same category; 
players might expect something more refreshing.
- **The Innovator**: The map sacrifices execution for creativity, resulting in awkward gameplay.  
<u>Remember that creativity should not be enforced in any map.</u>
