# Rating
Learn how the map rating works, this can come in handy to make mapsets

## Common terms
- Overmap: A map which includes more notes than it should. Typically presented with high divisor usage.
- Undermap: A map which includes fewer notes than it could. Notes are often omitted and emphasis is lowered too.

## Rating
In the game, there are 5 main difficulties, which come with their own patterns and restrictions:
- **Easy**:
  - Most maps should have no Quantum notes. 
  - Maps should be only going to 1/1 or very slow 1/2 beats.
  - 60 <= BPM < 100 (approx.)  

- **Medium**:
  - Maps should have up to light Quantum usage.
  - Maps should use 1/1 or slow 1/2 notes, have some other sounds thrown in as well as more difficult patterns. 
  - 1/3 and 1/4 could be used very occasionally.
  - 100 <= BPM <= 180 (approx.)
  
- **Hard**:
  - Maps should have up to light Quantum usage.
  - Maps shouldn't go over a certain cap (around 150 BPM on 1/2 for jumps and 1/4 for spirals) but can have a wide variety of patterns and divisors.
  - Minor skillset usage allowed, as long as the map stays consistent.
  - 180 <= BPM <= 240 (approx.)

- **LOGIC?**:
  - Maps can have from none to light Quantum usage. 
  - Maps can feature pretty much every pattern and divisor, as long as the map fits within the difficulty, and focus on a skillset.
  - Maps shouldn't go over the BPM cap, keeping the skillset they're focused on in mind. Some skillsets may have a lower cap.
  - 240 <= BPM <= 300 (approx.)

- **BRRR (SS) / Tasukete (SS+/Rhythia)**:
  - Maps can have from none to heavy Quantum usage.
  - Maps can have any pattern and divisor, and focus on a skillset.
  - No real BPM cap, but softcapped at around 450 BPM.
  - BRRR maps can be overmapped to fit within the difficulty scaling, however, keep this to a minimum.

You may take a look at some [archived maps](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OyiDMnREbLPb5gx3tzY01mdls0A-DVvj) to see some examples.  

## Exceptions
There's also some exceptions to these rules worth noting, such as:
- If the focus of the map requires using a high divisor, then the rules can be overridden.
- The BPM limit depends on the map's patterns.
- Undermapping is allowed and encouraged for any of the lower difficulties.
