# Rating
Learn how the map rating works, this can come in handy to make mapsets

## Common terms
- **Overmap**: A map which includes more notes than it should. Typically presented with high divisor usage.
- **Undermap**: A map which includes fewer notes than it could. Notes are often omitted and emphasis is lowered too.
- **Base BPM**: The BPM that a pattern should have to match the difficulty of a mainstream jump map.  
For example, a 400 BPM jump map could be considered equally hard as a 450 BPM spiral map.

In this case, we say spirals have a **+50 BPM offset**, since they're easier to play.

## Rating
In the game, there are 5 main difficulties, which come with their own patterns and restrictions:
- **Easy**:
  - Most maps should have no Quantum notes. 
  - Maps should feature 1/1 or very slow 1/2 beats.
  - Base BPM should be between **60** and **80** (approx.)  

- **Medium**:
  - Maps should have up to light Quantum usage.
  - Maps should feature 1/1 or slow 1/2 notes. 1/3 and 1/4 could be used very occasionally, as well as some more complicated patterns.
  - Base BPM should be between **80** and **120** (approx.)
  
- **Hard**:
  - Maps should have up to light Quantum usage.
  - Maps can have a wide variety of patterns and divisors.
  - Minor skillset usage allowed, as long as the map's difficulty fits.
  - Base BPM should be between **120** and **200** (approx.)

- **LOGIC?**:
  - Maps can have from none to light Quantum usage. 
  - Maps can feature pretty much every pattern and divisor and focus on one or more skillsets.
  - Maps shouldn't go over the BPM cap, keeping the skillset they're focused on in mind. Some skillsets may have a lower cap.
  - Base BPM should be between **200** and **300** (approx.)

- **BRRR (SS) / Tasukete (SS+/Rhythia)**:
  - Maps can have from none to heavy Quantum usage.
  - Maps can have any pattern and divisor, and must focus on at least one skillset.
  - Overmapping is allowed for the song to fit within the difficulty scaling, however, keep this to a minimum.
  - Base BPM should be higher than **300**, and not much greater than **450** BPM (approx.)

You may take a look at some [archived maps](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OyiDMnREbLPb5gx3tzY01mdls0A-DVvj) to see some examples.  

:::details You may change the difficulty name by importing the map using the **Vulnus map converter**, then converting it
back to SS+/Rhythia!
This doesn't mean a map is ranked or special in any way.

## Exceptions
There's also some exceptions to these rules worth noting, such as:
- If the focus of the map requires using a high divisor, then the rules can be overridden.
- The BPM limit depends on the map's patterns and/or skillsets.
- Undermapping is allowed and encouraged for any of the lower difficulties.
