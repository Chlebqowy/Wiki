# Rating
Learn how the map rating works, this can come in handy to make mapsets or just to get a general sense of difficulty

:::warning
It is recommended to check out the following articles before reading:
- [Quantum usage](basic-quantum-usage.md)
- [Patterns](mapping-patterns.md)
- [Skillsets](skillsets.md)
:::

## Common terms
- **Overmap**: A map which includes more notes than it should. Typically presented with high divisor usage.
- **Undermap**: A map which includes fewer notes than it should. Notes are often omitted and emphasis is lowered too.

## Considerations
- When talking about BPM limits:
- - Flicks/Jumps are considered to be mapped in 1/2 divisor with the stated BPM.
- - Streams/Spirals are considered to be mapped in 1/4 divisor with the stated BPM.
- Quantum patterns should resemble the behaviour (speed and movement) of certain regular patterns.

## Difficulty Ratings
In the game, there are **5** difficulties, which come with their own patterns and restrictions:
- **Easy**:
  - Only 3x3 ongrid patterns are allowed.
  - No real BPM limit, but keep the difficulty lower than Medium.

- **Medium**:
  - Maps can have Quantum patterns, preferably as low-divisor BÃ©zier curves at most. Offgrid is forbidden.
  - No real BPM limit, but keep the difficulty harder than Easy.
  
- **Hard**:
  - Maps can have any sort of Quantum patterns, 
  as long as the difficulty stays consistently under LOGIC?. Offgrid is forbidden.
  - Minor skillset usage allowed, as long as the map's difficulty fits.
  - BPM should be between **175** and **250** (approx.)

- **LOGIC?**:
  - Maps can have any sort of Quantum patterns, including offgrid, 
  as long as the difficulty stays consistently under BRRR.
  - Maps should focus on at least one skillset.
  - BPM should be between **250** and **350** (approx.)

- **BRRR (SS) & Tasukete (SS+/Rhythia)**:
  - Maps can have any sort of Quantum patterns, but make the patterns clear at all times; 
  avoid messy patterns.
  - Maps must focus on at least one skillset.
  - Base BPM should be between **350** and **500** BPM (approx.)

You may take a look at some [archived maps](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OyiDMnREbLPb5gx3tzY01mdls0A-DVvj) to see some examples.

## Exceptions
There's also some exceptions to these rules worth noting, such as:
- If the map requires using a certain pattern for **expression**, the rules can be overridden to a certain extent.
- Undermapping is allowed and encouraged for any of the lower difficulties.
- Overmapping can be done on LOGIC?+ difficulties as long as it fits the song and to fit within the difficulty scaling.
