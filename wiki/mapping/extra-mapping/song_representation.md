# Song Representation
Learn how to improve your beatmap representation

## Sync
### 3-5-9 Patterning
You should think of patterns which length modulo the beat divisor results in 0,
  or a whole divisor of said beat divisor. This helps produce slides and spirals faster.

:::tip
For example, when mapping over a **binary** [time signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature) (like 4/4),
you can structure most patterns in groups of 3, 5 and 9 notes.

For the example above, you may use:
- 2 % 4 = 2, then 2 + 1 = **3** notes (2 is one of 4's divisors)
- 4 % 4 = 0, then 4 + 1 = **5** notes
- 8 % 4 = 0, then 8 + 1 = **9** notes
- etc.

This is also where the name comes from.

## Structure

### Rhythmic layering
- Work on your **rhythmic layering**. This can be done by:
    - Selecting a **main melody** to follow (it should stand out the most).
    - Incorporating other rhythms in the song onto it (if needed)
      while giving each one the right amount of **emphasis** (see below).  
      _Remember that the main melody can be overridden at any given point!_

## Emphasis

### Spacing
