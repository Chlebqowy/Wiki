# Styles
Learn how to develop a mapping style

:::warning
It is recommended to read [this document](../basic-mapping/skillsets.md) before proceeding.

## Introduction
A style is a way of producing patterns for maps. Different mappers may have different understanding of what mapping is,
or reasons to map, such as:
- Self-accomplishment
- Public recognition
- Pushing the skill ceiling further up
- etc.

In this document, we'll go over the main mapping styles in Rhythia.

## Styles and the style spectrum
The style spectrum is a general concept that most (if not all) rhythm games subtly include,
which classifies maps depending on their patterning on a gradient scale, or an alignment chart, among other examples.
The "categories" in this case are treated as the edge cases, 
meaning a map will normally fall in between them.

Since this game shares gameplay similarities with "Mania" rhythm games (such as "osu!mania"),
we will be using that spectrum as a reference to define ours.  

According to it, there are 2 main types of maps:
- **Speed**
- **Tech**
These can be applied to Rhythia as follows.

For the sake of making things clear, the examples showcased here could be considered edge cases.

### Mainstream/Speed
The most basic style, involving simple patterns which rely on **stamina/drain**, **consistency** and **speed**.   
Most maps follow this style because players barely struggle at playing it.
- Example\[1]:
  <video width="1920" height="1080" controls>
    <source src="/src/video/speed.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>   

### Tech
This style focuses on technical patterns, which require great **reading** and wrist **control** skills.   
Although it can be very complex to fully understand, we can subdivide tech into categories based on the skill requirements:
- **Light tech**: Focuses _lightly_ (as the name implies) on **both** skills
  - Example\[2]:
    <video width="1920" height="1080" controls>
      <source src="/src/video/nmfull.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>    
- **Heavy tech**: Focuses on **both** skills 
  - Example\[3]:   
    <video width="1920" height="1080" controls>
      <source src="/src/video/heavy.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>  
- **Unconventional**: Focuses heavily on **reading**
  - Example\[4]: 
    <video width="1920" height="1080" controls>
      <source src="/src/video/unconv.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>  
- **Antiflow**: Focuses heavily on wrist **control**
  - Example\[5]:
    <video width="1920" height="1080" controls>
      <source src="/src/video/antiflo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>  
  
## Summary
- You may develop your style depending on your gameplay experience, your own ideas and how you envision maps. 
- Although not all maps fall strictly into one category, they may be recognised by their closest end on the style spectrum.
