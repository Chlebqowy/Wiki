# Manual BPM Timing
Learn how to time songs without using any external references.   
**Remember you can set up a timing point in _Timing_ >> _Open BPM Settings_.**

## Common terms
- **Subdivision**: To split a beat in several, smaller ones. This can be achieved by raising the beat divisor.
- **Syncopation**: A note instance which doesn't snap to a beat divisor.

## Creating a timing point
To set up a timing point correctly, you'll need the right BPM/Offset values, which can be found as follows:
1. First, get the song Offset, or the difference between the start of the song and the start of the map.
   1. Enable the **Metronome** function
   2. Lower your speed down to 50% or less to find out the timestamp of the first sound of the song.  
   If _Enable Waveform_ is on, you can try to match the beat lines with the start of the waves' crests on the track.
2. Once you get the timestamp, try playing the song up to the timing point.
The first metronome tick should match the first sound you want to map.
3. Change the beat divisor to 1 (recommended), and play the song past the timing point. 
   - If the metronome tick is _consistently_ off sync, the **offset** is wrong.
   - If the metronome tick gets _progressively_ off sync, the **BPM** is wrong.  
     These cases aren't mutually exclusive: both could happen at once.
4. If you didn't have any issues up to here, you're good to go!

:::tip  
Though perfect sync is not required, try to time the map as precisely as possible.
- A general offbeat measure is **5-10ms**, anything more than **15ms** will feel off.
- The metronome tick is **28ms** off compared to the note hit sound.
:::

## Constant BPM songs - 1 timing point
The easiest kind of song to time. You'll only need to set up **one** timing point, and it'll last for the whole map.  
Most songs fall into this category.

## Variable BPM songs - Many timing points
If you try to set up just a timing point, you'll notice that the metronome tick gets progressively offbeat. 
Keep setting up timing points until there are no more BPM changes to be found.
We will split them into 2 cases:
- **Regular**: Located on a whole beat (main beat line)

- **Syncopated**: Not located on a whole beat (ex. below snapped to a 1/8 beat)  
![SyncopatedTimingPoint](/src/map/syncopatedTimingPoint.jpg)

:::tip
Since syncopated timing points are not located on whole beats, consider subdividing the current BPM to snap them.

## Edge cases

### Fixing no-snap syncopation
If there's a note which can't be snapped to any beat divisor,
you can override the current BPM at the timestamp by setting a timing point there.

### Ad-libitum, or free tempo songs
Certain songs, like live performances or experimental songs, may not have a fixed BPM, 
but they fluctuate around certain ones.  
An example could be [rosso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIBXD0mVNIk) by jizue. 
It may seem like the speed is constant, but if you look closely, 
you'll notice the performers play subtly faster or slower depending on the mood of the song.

In order to deal with this problem:
- Focus on a melody or beat (especially drums).
- Override the BPM whenever you need (every whole beat should suffice), using subdivision if necessary.

## Summary
- To set up a timing point properly:
  - Get the Offset first using â‰¤50% playback speed.
  - Then, get the BPM by snapping with the metronome.
- Make sure the map is 15ms off AT MOST.
- Using subdivision may help find any syncopation cases (when the timing point isn't on a whole beat).
