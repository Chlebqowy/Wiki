# Refining your maps
Learn how to improve and polish your own maps 

## Common terms
- **Subdivision**: To split a beat in several, smaller ones. This can be achieved by raising the beat divisor.

## Introduction
You may have noticed there is a huge quality gap between some maps. 
This is because mappers have self-developed tips and tricks to improve their maps both during the
mapping process.  

In this article, we'll be going over some of them; you may be familiar with certain ones if you have prior experience.

:::tip
**Creativity** relies fully on the mapper and the current mapping context, thus no external methods can be used.

## Execution
- **Alternating flow**: Instead of keeping the player from going on the same direction forever, it's better to 
switch direction every few seconds. A good idea would be to use circular flow in between 

:::info
Vibros are an exception to this rule.

## Representation
- **3-5-9 Patterning**: You should think of patterns which length modulo the beat divisor results in 0, 
or a whole divisor of said beat divisor. This helps produce slides and spirals faster.

:::tip
For example, when mapping over a **binary** [time signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature) (like 4/4),
you can structure most patterns in groups of 3, 5 and 9 notes.

For the example above, you may use:
- 2 % 4 = 2, then 2 + 1 = **3** notes (2 is one of 4's divisors)
- 4 % 4 = 0, then 4 + 1 = **5** notes
- 8 % 4 = 0, then 8 + 1 = **9** notes
- etc.  

This is also where the name comes from.

- **Speed changes**: A way of introducing emphasis changes (without changing the song's BPM) is by editing the
**spacing** between notes.
- In general, intense sections should have a wider spacing as break sections, and vice versa.
- Quantum can also be used to make smaller gap differences when increasing/decreasing the map's intensity.

- **Melodic layering**: Sometimes it's better to plan mapping a section beforehand, since there are cases where 
overlapping 2 or more patterns, each corresponding to a different melody/rhythm, results in an awkward rhythm choice.  
Songs with multiple time signatures at once will often have this issue.  

To solve this, it's important to <u>focus on more than one melody ONLY if necessary</u>.
- If a new melody is introduced, but it clashes with the current rhythmic structure, 
you can switch one melody out with the new one.
