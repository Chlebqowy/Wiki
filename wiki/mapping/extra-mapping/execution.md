## Flow
The **flow** of a pattern is the **direction** in which it goes.
For example, **QWEDC** goes right, then down.

We can classify it into different types:
- **Vertical**: Up-down or vice versa
- **Horizontal**: Left-right or vice versa
- **Circular**: In circles (clock-wise or counter-clockwise)

Generally, flow indicates the **deviance** between where you expect to go next and where you're supposed to.   
While playing inside your comfort zone, flow might not be noticeable.
Your flow depends on the **maps** you play, the **patterns** you enjoy/hate most or the ones you find easier/harder,
and your general **ability** to play the game as well.
