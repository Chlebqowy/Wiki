# Problem detection and self-modding
Learn how to identify common problems in your maps

## Introduction
While you may feel a map is fine, others may find issues with them and will encourage you to change what's
wrong. This is known as **modding** or **reviewing** and it's a common practice among mappers.

### Execution flaws
- **Difficulty dragging**: A map section's difficulty is greatly inflated/deflated forcefully by the mapper,
who wants a map that can fit in their envisioned difficulty range. 

:::details
This concept encompasses both difficulty spikes and difficulty drops.
:::

- **?**: The patterns in the map feel way too predictable, so the player is not engaged.
For example, when patterns are copypasted too much, or the flow doesn't change for a long while.

### Representation flaws
- **Overmapping**: The map has sections which are too dense/intense for the map.
- **Undermapping**: 
- **BPM/Offset misusage**: The map has got at least one timing point wrong.
