# Extra 01: Mapping Theory applied to SSQE
Learn a more general approach towards mapping

:::warning
Please learn basic mapping before reading this, or read the basic articles first.

## Intro: Why learn mapping theory?
- It can help you spend less time mapping, but requires more time thinking
- It helps you produce quality-consistent maps
- It helps you gather experience and make quick decisions while mapping

You could rely on self-learning forever, but it'll take you a few years to learn 

## The mapping process
The mapping process can be divided into two separated processes:
- **Brainstorming**: Gathering ideas for your map
  - Starts with a mapping **approach** for a determined song:
    - Gameplay (playability)
    - Patterns (representation/creativity)
    - Difficulty (challenge maps)
    - ...
  - Sometimes this process goes on subconsciously, without the mapper thinking actively about it (*intuition*)
- **Execution**: Transforming ideas into patterns
  - Based on **decision-making**:
    - Which patterns fit within the map the most?
    - Which patterns give the most potentially beneficial outcomes?
    - ...

**The goal of mapping is to create an engaging experience, something that reflects the overall mood of the song**.  
This can be accomplished via:
- **Entertainment**: Making the map appeal to a target audience
- **Consistency**: Distributing your ideas roughly equally over the map
- **Contrast**: Making the map differ from other existing maps

These concepts altogether make up the **quality** of a map.

### Example: Trial and error
A mapping contest is happening, where various independent mappers with different experience levels map the same song:
- A mapper may decide that gameplay is the way to go, and focus less on the representation
- Another mapper may think of the patterns earlier, in order to better express the map's mood
- Yet another mapper may want to show off their distinct style, although it may not fit the song
- etc.

**Some of these approaches might be worse than others depending on the map and the mapper, 
and might hinder the map's quality.**  
To understand which one fits the map most, they might need to repeat the mapping process over and over.

This is called **trial and error**, and it's the simplest mapping approach:
- Take the last map you made, get feedback, improve from feedback, repeat
- Reliant on the community skill/mapping level
- Sometimes feedback can be "misleading": not all opinions are right or proper

## Theoretic Mapping: Key Aspects
This is another mapping approach, based on analyzing how a map will be played.  
We'll break the action of hitting a note down into **subactions**:
- Reading the note: Visual + Rhythm = **Representation**
- Moving the cursor: **Gameplay**

These are the variables you can change while mapping, and thus the **criteria** to judge a map as well:
- **Gameplay**: The action of playing
- **Representation**: The action of reading

**Creativity**, the third and final judging criteria, is a constant which is normally decided during the brainstorming process,
thus it should NOT vary to improve a map while you're making it (ignores the Consistency principle):
- If overused, it can hinder the other key aspects (ex. Quantum overmaps)
- If ignored, it can make maps less engaging since the player knows what to expect

Adding more speed/harder patterns helps the player stay on their feet and makes maps more entertaining: 
this is the main focus of **challenge maps**.

**Balancing Gameplay and Creativity without hindering Representation** is the main goal of this approach.

### Example: Mapping priorities
An example of a mapping decision could happen while mapping a heavy kicks section.  
There has been discussion about how heavy kicks are hard to represent in SS/Rhythia mapping. 
Let's consider the following possibilities:
- **Jumps** will surely boost the Gameplay aspect, but hinder Creativity and Representation
- **Meganotes** can easily boost Representation, but they can also backlash due to their weight in terms of Gameplay
- **Slides** can hinder Gameplay if they don't flow properly, but they usually weigh less than meganotes 
and offer similar results in terms of both Representation and Creativity

From here, we can make ourselves a rough, mental composition:
- **Jumps**:
  - [+] Gameplay
  - [=] Representation
  - [-] Creativity
- **Meganotes**:
  - [+] Representation
  - [=] Creativity, Gameplay
  - [-] None
- **Slides**:
  - [+] Representation
  - [=] Creativity
  - [-] Gameplay

We can see that all three aspects of mapping are involved, so **we'll choose a pattern depending on how we want to execute the map.**  
For example, if you were aiming for **gameplay**, you'd probably want to choose **jumps** despite knowing the map will lack on the creative side.

_But this decision isn't absolute._ You might want to change the pattern type depending on the **intensity** of the kicks, for example.

The ideas exposed earlier are **mapping priorities**: decisions you take while mapping to ensure the map's final quality is as desired.

## Evaluating a map
Finally, let's evaluate a map section I made (featured in [SSWC21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xPx8FZLyYBPs1EDfdL6wOF9du1FNBY7xc0PS5LFvaD4/edit#gid=861287609)), 
and see if we can find and fix any potential flaws according to the aspects we talked about earlier.
The source data for it is [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/uygsaufhbjasd/dfb8ddf2b66d9086fb76a0d2f1c2263f/raw/091b077ef7a002a8ad60840ebf751e5622d8f0f4/a%2520gist)
and this is the [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X77UqVbytow&list=PLaN19gIKi5ZrjNT-KAuFeB82fmykcF8bK&index=59) used for it.
Keep in mind the offset needs to be adjusted (since a Roblox LID was used).

### Example: Improving a map
As explained earlier, we can improve a map while taking Gameplay and Representation into account. 
Let's take a look at the drop between 196094ms (3:16:094) and 218951ms (3:38:951):
#### Gameplay
**Note**: I will not get into the patterns themselves, nor flow to simplify things.  

The section starts with some jumps mixed with slides here and there (a typical old-style map structure), 
and there's few breaks in between as well which match with the song's.  
Then, at 208285ms (3:28:285) the jump speed is halved, which is a nice break for the player. 
There are some bursts too, to increase the contrast between the melody and the speedcore sections, making the section more interesting.  
Lastly, the section ends with some regular jumps followed by two slides.  

To summarize, the section is consistent and entertaining, and uses contrast to improve the map's quality.

#### Song Representation (WIP)
As one can notice if they slow down the map, the sync of this section is poor.
- The map has various missing notes
