# Skillsets
Learn how patterns affect skillsets

## Definition
A skillset is the ability to perform better in certain scenarios, usually as a consequence of practicing certain types of maps.
It's based on a series of more general skills, associated with rhythm games. Said skills are as follows:
- Stamina: The ability to keep playing without becoming drained.
- Control: The ability to adjust your cursor speed with ease.
- Aim: The ability to hit patterns precisely.
- Flow: The ability to adjust your cursor movement with ease.
- Reading: The ability to understand patterns just by looking at them easily.
- Consistency: The ability to keep your skill level consistent for long periods of time.

## Types, patterns and required skills
Here's a list with all the available skillsets, the patterns with which they are usually made up and the skills they focus on:
- **Jumps**: Notes far across enough from one another.
  - Patterns: Jumps
  - Required skills: Stamina, aim
- **Stacks**: Groups of notes stacked behind each other.
  - Patterns: Stacks (0-displacement jumps) mixed with any other pattern
  - Required skills: Control, aim, reading
- **Streams**: Long sequences of notes close to one another.
  - Patterns: Spirals
  - Required skills: Reading
- **Spins**: Notes arranged in any type of way that can be hit with a spinning motion. 
  - Patterns: Any pattern that flows in a circular motion 
  - Required skills: Control
- **Slides**: Short sequences of notes close to one another. 
  - Patterns: Slides
  - Required skills: Reading
- **Tech**: A map section that uses more technical patterns. 
  - Patterns: Any pattern, as long as it doesn't have an obvious flow to it 
  - Required skills: Control, aim, flow, reading
- **Stamina** A map section that goes on long enough to wear down your physical stamina.
  - Patterns: Any pattern as long as it fits, but especially jumps
  - Required skills: Stamina, consistency
- **Bursts**: Patterns which are generally faster than the map's current pace.
  - Patterns: Any pattern, as long as it fits
  - Required skills: Control
- **Offgrid**: Notes which are outside the regular 3x3 play area, thus looking smaller ingame.
  - Patterns: Any pattern, as long as it fits
  - Required skills: Stamina, aim
- **Quantum**: Notes which don't follow the guidelines of the typical 3x3 grid.
  - Patterns: Any pattern, as long as it fits
  - Required skills: Aim, reading
- **Vibros**: Repetitive jumps which are relatively fast compared to the map's pace.
  - Patterns: Any pattern, as long as it fits
  - Required skills: Stamina, control
- **Consistency**: A map section that focuses on keeping your aim consistent.
  - Patterns: Any pattern, as long as it fits
  - Required skills: Stamina, consistency
- **Reading**: A map section which is hard to read.
  - Patterns: Any pattern, as long as it fits
  - Required skills: Aim, reading
- **Timing**: A map section that focuses on strict measuring and tricky rhythms.
  - Patterns: Any pattern, as long as it fits
  - Required skills: Control, aim
- **Unconventional**: A map section that has some very unique pattern usage.
  - Patterns: Any pattern, as long as it fits
  - Required skills: Control, aim, flow, reading
- **Gimmick**: A map section (or an entire map) that has some very specific pattern usage.
  - Patterns: Any pattern, as long as it fits
  - Required skills: TBD

:::tip
The more requirements a skillset has, the harder it will usually be. This affects maps' difficulty, regardless of BPM. For example:  
- [Livin' la ViDRRR Loca](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1120882599552880724/1122786940941508648/zitro_dive-tek_-_livin_la_vidrrr_loca_full_ver.sspm)
has a rating around 40* (9.24* on PPv1)
- [Kyu-kurarin (7_7 Bootleg)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1120882599552880724/1181372626724192287/haxagon_-_iyowa_-_kyu-kurarin_7_7_bootleg.sspm?ex=6580d1ff&is=656e5cff&hm=bdbeab04c90c5a7d8302e8d30f2f372cf53941266fc045c6876fc638f3cd75f7&)
has a star rating around 60* (11.09* on PPv1)
Both maps have a similar base BPM, but Kyu-kurarin also includes more skillsets (7) than Livin' la ViDRRR Loca (3).
