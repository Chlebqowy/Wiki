# Mapping aspects
Learn the main aspects that make up a map

## Introduction
There are some common **traits** for every map that enhance the gameplay experience, which are:
- **Execution**
- **Song Representation**
- **Creativity**

### Execution
This concept encompasses every **in-game** aspect of a map; in other words, how the map plays out in terms of:
- Patterns
- Flow/Movement
- Difficulty

### Song Representation
This concept refers to everything that can be seen in the editor: 
- Sync
- Rhythmic structure
- Emphasis

### Creativity
This concept focuses on finding ideas for maps and their further development during map making.  
Unlike the others, this is only important while the map is being made, and cannot be changed afterward.
