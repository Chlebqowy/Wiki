# Mapping aspects
Learn the main aspects that make up a map

## Introduction
There are some common **traits** for every map that enhance the gameplay experience, which are:
- **Execution**: The **player**'s perspective of a map.
- **(Song) Representation**: The **mapper**'s perspective of a map.
- **Creativity**: How innovative a map is.

_Finding the right balance between the three is key to approach mapping as a whole._
From a general standpoint, **Execution > Representation > Creativity**, but this depends on each mapper.

### Execution
This concept encompasses every **in-game** aspect of a map:
- **Patterns**: The note distribution throughout the map.
- **Flow**: The way the player is required to move to beat the map.
- **Difficulty**: How easy/hard the map is to beat.

[This article](../extra-mapping/execution.md) explains this concept in depth.

### Song Representation
This concept refers to everything that can be seen in the **editor**: 
- **Sync**: How the notes in the map correspond to the sounds in the song.
- **Structure**: How each pattern in the song is represented.
- **Emphasis**: How noticeable each pattern in the song should be.

[This article](../extra-mapping/song_representation) explains this concept in depth.

### Creativity
This concept focuses on **finding ideas** for maps and their further development during map making.

[This article](../extra-mapping/creativity.md) explains this concept in depth.
